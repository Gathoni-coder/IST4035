<section id="history">
  <h2>History of Vegetarian Cuisine</h2>
  <p>
    Vegetarianism has been practiced for thousands of years, with roots in ancient
    civilizations such as India, Greece, and Egypt. Many early vegetarians adopted
    the lifestyle for spiritual, cultural, or health reasons.
  </p>

  <h3>Ancient Origins</h3>
  <p>
    In India, vegetarianism is closely tied to religions like Hinduism, Buddhism,
    and Jainism, which emphasize non-violence towards all living beings.
    Ancient Greek philosophers such as Pythagoras also promoted plant-based diets
    as a path to purity and well-being.
  </p>

  <h3>Modern Developments</h3>
  <p>
    During the 19th and 20th centuries, vegetarian societies formed in Europe and
    America, spreading awareness about the health and ethical benefits of a
    plant-based diet. Today, vegetarian cuisine continues to evolve, blending
    traditional dishes with modern cooking innovations.
